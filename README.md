## HTML, CSS and JS updates to the Website

To make my personal portfolio website better, these are the changes I've made:

HTML:
- No more filler content, everything added: Ensures that the website is complete and has actual content to read through.
- Swapped out old skills/experiences/projects page to the new one (all navigation fixed): Allows for a more visual representation of all my skills/experiences and projects.

CSS:
- Changed styling skills/experiences/projects page to include two columns that are subdivided: Allows for a better visual experience when looking through the technical page.
- Re-styled the cards: Enables for the title, image, text to be easily readable on the dynamically created cards.

JavaScript:
- Loading the cards based on major/skill rather than into one container: enables loading cards into 6 different containers dynamically - improves scalability.
- Flicker when switching pages when on light mode fixed: creates a cleaner, more refined look by applying theme before rendering page.
